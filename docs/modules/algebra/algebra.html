        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Algebra?</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t need to be a math expert to use encryption — but understanding its foundations helps you trust (and question) the tools. 
          At the heart of encryption are a few key ideas from abstract algebra: groups, primes, modular arithmetic, and one-way functions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Groups and Inverses</h2>
        <p>
          In algebra, a <span data-tooltip="A set with a rule that combines elements and supports inversion, identity, and closure.">group</span> is a set where you can combine elements and undo any operation. 
          For example, with the numbers {0, 1, 2}, if adding two numbers always gives you another number in the set, and every number has an inverse, then it’s a group.
        </p>
        <p>
          In encryption, we usually work in <strong>modular groups</strong> — where the numbers "wrap around" after hitting a limit (a modulus).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Modular Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>
          If a regular clock goes from 1 to 12, modular arithmetic is how you tell time. In mod 12, 9 + 5 = 2. The numbers loop back after reaching a certain value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modular arithmetic makes sure that encrypted data stays within a defined set of numbers. This is a key part of why cryptography can work securely in digital systems.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Prime Fields and Cyclic Groups</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>prime field</strong> is a modular system where the modulus is a prime number. These are used because they don’t allow division errors or shortcuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within these fields, we often use <strong>cyclic groups</strong> — groups generated by repeatedly applying one operation. This structure is predictable but hard to reverse, making it ideal for encryption.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">One-Way Functions</h2>
        <p>
          A one-way function is something that’s easy to do, but very hard to undo without special knowledge.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s easy to multiply two prime numbers. It’s hard to factor their product.</li>
          <li>It’s easy to exponentiate a number. It’s hard to find the original number from the result — this is called the <strong>discrete logarithm problem</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are the mathematical traps that make encryption strong. Even if someone intercepts your message, they can’t “undo” the math without the key.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h2>
        <p>
          Modern encryption often uses <strong>elliptic curve cryptography</strong> (ECC). These are smooth curves plotted over prime fields, and they form a special kind of group.
        </p>
        <p>
          ECC offers strong security with much smaller key sizes — which means faster encryption, less bandwidth, and lower energy use.
