      <h1>‚öñÔ∏è Encryption Ethics (ETHICS)</h1>
      <p>Encryption isn‚Äôt just technical ‚Äî it‚Äôs social, political, and personal. This module asks: who benefits, who‚Äôs left out, and what values shape our tools?</p>
    </header>

    <main class="module-content">

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Ethics?</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption changes how we communicate, trust, and resist. But these changes have consequences. Ethics helps us ask: who gets protection, and who gets left behind?
        </p>
        <p>
          As Phillip Rogaway wrote, cryptography is not neutral ‚Äî it changes who holds power. Using or designing encryption is a political act.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Obfuscation vs. Secrecy</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone can use perfect encryption ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Obfuscation is another strategy. It doesn‚Äôt hide data completely. It makes it harder to find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obfuscation works by creating noise: fake data, confusing signals, and uncertainty. It‚Äôs not about silence. It‚Äôs about surviving surveillance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Access Is Political</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption tools like GPG and Tor are powerful ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not always accessible. They‚Äôre hard to use, full of jargon, and badly documented.
        </p>
        <p>
          If privacy depends on technical skill, then only the most privileged get privacy. That‚Äôs a political problem ‚Äî and we can solve it with better design and better education.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Law, Power, and Control</h2>
        <p>
          Governments around the world want more access to encrypted data. They pass laws to ban strong encryption, demand backdoors, or force people to unlock their devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          These laws often don‚Äôt stop crime ‚Äî they punish activists, journalists, and immigrants. When encryption becomes suspicious, privacy becomes a risk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Legal Fight Over Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption cases are popping up in courts across the country. These decisions shape how far governments can go ‚Äî and whether your phone is still your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law is still catching up. Judges don‚Äôt always understand how encryption works. But the big questions are clear: Can you be forced to unlock your phone? Can a company be forced to break its own security?
        </p>
        <p>
          These cases matter because they shape your rights in a digital world. If encryption protects you, then weakening it puts everyone at risk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Important Cases You Should Know</h2>

        <h3>üîì Commonwealth v. Jones (2019)</h3>
        <p>
          Massachusetts ruled that if the government can prove you know your phone‚Äôs password, it can force you to unlock it. They call it a ‚Äúforegone conclusion.‚Äù But that lowers the bar dangerously.
        </p>

        <h3>üß† Eleventh Circuit Cases</h3>
        <p>
          These courts ruled that the government must already know what they‚Äôre looking for before they can demand access. That protects your right to stay silent ‚Äî and not help build the case against you.
        </p>

        <h3>üì± Apple v. FBI (2016)</h3>
        <p>
          After a mass shooting, the FBI asked Apple to break into an iPhone. Apple said no ‚Äî arguing that building a tool like that would hurt all users. The government eventually dropped the case.
        </p>

        <h3>üìÇ United States v. Hubbell (2000)</h3>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court said that producing documents could be a kind of testimony. Unlocking a device might count too ‚Äî because it shows you control the contents.
        </p>

        <p>
          These rulings shape how digital privacy works today ‚Äî and whether encryption remains a right, or just a privilege.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">What Ethical Encryption Looks Like</h2>
        <p>
          Good encryption is simple, well-explained, and doesn‚Äôt rely on trust in corporations. It protects people who aren‚Äôt tech experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, it gives control back to users. Not to companies. Not to governments.
        </p>
        <p>
          To build ethical tools is to build freedom ‚Äî not invisibility, but refusal.
