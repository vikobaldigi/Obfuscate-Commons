      <h1>⚖️ Encryption Ethics (ETHICS)</h1>
      <p>Encryption doesn’t just protect — it reshapes power. Who it shields, who it excludes, and who it enables are deeply ethical questions.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Ethics?</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptographic systems aren’t neutral. As Phillip Rogaway argues, they rearrange power: who can speak freely, who can watch, and who cannot.
          Encryption resists surveillance — but also enforces exclusion. Its use is always political, whether acknowledged or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ask how encryption works is also to ask who it works for — and who gets left behind when the tools are too opaque, too difficult, or too embedded in tech industry logic.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Protection vs. Obfuscation</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone needs military-grade encryption. But everyone needs some way to shield themselves from extractive visibility.
          For some, that’s strong cryptography. For others, it’s blending in — obfuscation, noise, misdirection.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Brunton and Nissenbaum remind us: “privacy” doesn’t always mean silence. Sometimes it means strategic confusion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Accessibility and Autonomy</h2>
        <p>
          Many encryption tools are hard to use. Documentation is scarce. Interfaces are brittle. Even when people want to protect themselves, the barrier to entry is high.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s an ethical problem. Because if only the most technically fluent can encrypt — then protection becomes a form of privilege, not a right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making encryption accessible isn’t just UX work. It’s redistribution.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Law, Violence, and Regulation</h2>
        <p>
          Governments often frame encryption as a threat — a way for criminals to hide. But what gets missed in that framing are the everyday people 
          who use encryption to survive: journalists, migrants, whistleblowers, organizers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When laws restrict encryption, they don’t just target bad actors. They criminalize protection itself. And they put more trust in surveillance 
          than in the people resisting it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Toward an Ethical Practice</h2>
        <p>
          Using encryption is not a neutral act. Nor is teaching it. It’s a decision to prioritize safety over convenience, clarity over secrecy, 
          and community over compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encrypt not to disappear — but to appear on our own terms.
