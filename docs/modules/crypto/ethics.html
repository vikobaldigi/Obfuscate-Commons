        <h2 class="section-heading">Encryption Is Political</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption is not neutral. It redistributes power. It decides who can speak safely, who can be surveilled, who gets to disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments may frame it as a threat. Activists may rely on it to survive. Corporations may sell it as a feature while hoarding your metadata.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Privacy vs. Secrecy</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy is not the same as secrecy. Privacy is a boundary. Secrecy is an intention. Encryption can support both — or be misused to undermine them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whistleblowers, journalists, survivors — they need encryption to protect dignity and truth. But so do abusers, fraudsters, and regimes. The same tools serve many ends.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Obfuscation as Protest</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone can encrypt. But everyone can obfuscate. Add noise. Disrupt patterns. Confuse extractive systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Brunton and Nissenbaum argue, obfuscation is not deception — it’s refusal. It’s a tactic of the weak against the strong. A politics of ambiguity.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Ethical Questions to Consider</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Should encryption be a universal right?</li>
          <li>What are the costs of criminalizing secrecy?</li>
          <li>When does secure communication become a threat?</li>
          <li>Who designs encryption standards — and for whom?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ethics isn’t just about what encryption does. It’s about who it enables, who it excludes, and what values it encodes.
