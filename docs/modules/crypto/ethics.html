      <h1>⚖️ Encryption Ethics (ETHICS)</h1>
      <p>Encryption doesn't just protect — it reshapes power. Who it shields, who it excludes, and who it enables are deeply ethical questions.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Ethics?</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptographic systems aren’t neutral. As Phillip Rogaway argues, they rearrange power: who can speak freely, who can watch, and who cannot.
          Encryption resists surveillance — but it can also entrench secrecy for the powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption protects rights — but can also shield abuse. The tension between safety and freedom lies at the heart of every encryption debate.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Obfuscation as Resistance</h2>
        <p>
          Helen Nissenbaum and Finn Brunton frame obfuscation not as deception, but as refusal — a tactic within systems that demand legibility.
          Obfuscation disrupts surveillance by introducing noise, ambiguity, and unpredictability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike encryption, which must be precise and strong, obfuscation can be lightweight and everyday — randomized search histories,
          spoofed locations, artificial fingerprints.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Dual Use Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption is a dual-use technology: it protects dissent and journalism — and also organized crime.
          This complexity is often used to argue for backdoors or government keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          But “lawful access” creates structural vulnerabilities. As history shows, these weaknesses often expand beyond their intended use.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Responsibility of Cryptographers</h2>
        <p>
          Rogaway writes that cryptographers are moral agents. What they choose to build — or not build — defines the limits of power.
          Cryptography encodes values.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design systems that prioritize autonomy over compliance</li>
          <li>Resist funding or partnerships that embed control or bias</li>
          <li>Build with users, not just institutions, in mind</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Questions to Ask</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Who is allowed to encrypt — and who is excluded?</li>
          <li>Who controls the keys?</li>
          <li>What metadata remains exposed, and to whom?</li>
          <li>Is trust centralized or distributed?</li>
          <li>Who benefits most — and who is most at risk?</li>
        </ul>
