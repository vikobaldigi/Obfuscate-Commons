      <h1>Asymmetric Encryption (KEYPAIR)</h1>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Keypairs?</h2>
        <p>
          Symmetric encryption assumes a shared secret — sender and receiver both know the same key, and both must keep it safe.
          That works, but only if you’ve already established trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asymmetric encryption breaks that model. You can share your public key openly, and anyone can use it to send you encrypted data — but only you can decrypt it with your private key.
          It’s a shift that makes secure communication possible without prior agreement or centralized control.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t just a cryptographic trick — it redefines who gets to initiate trust, and how digital identity is constructed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> Used to encrypt messages or verify signatures. Safe to distribute.</li>
          <li><strong>Private Key:</strong> Used to decrypt or sign. Must stay secret.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These two keys are mathematically linked — but computing the private key from the public key is infeasible if the math is sound.
          Common algorithms include RSA (factoring), ElGamal and DSA (discrete logs), and ECC (elliptic curves).
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">From Theory to Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          In 1976, Diffie and Hellman introduced the idea of public-key exchange. RSA followed shortly after, providing the first practical implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, keypairs power much of the internet: HTTPS, SSH, email signatures, cryptocurrency wallets, and secure messaging.
          They make it possible to verify identity and confidentiality — even in open, adversarial environments.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Trust Problem</h2>
        <p>
          If someone sends you a public key claiming to be from your bank, how do you know it’s legitimate?
          This is the classic “man-in-the-middle” attack — and it’s where public-key systems start to depend on external validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certificate authorities (CAs) are one solution. They form the backbone of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure),
          but they also reintroduce centralized trust — and all the risk that comes with it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Cautionary Notes</h2>
        <p>
          Keypairs are powerful, but not perfect. The math is strong, but real-world systems still fail:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reusing keys across systems can leak context</li>
          <li>Weak randomness undermines key generation</li>
          <li>Padding and side-channel attacks target implementation gaps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In practice, security depends not just on theory — but on how code gets written, shared, and maintained.
