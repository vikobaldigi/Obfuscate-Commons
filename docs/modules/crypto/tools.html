        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Tools Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption isn’t just theory — it’s implementation. Code becomes infrastructure, and infrastructure shapes possibility. 
          These tools define how we protect speech, structure consent, and resist surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open-source libraries matter not just because they’re free — but because they’re transparent. They can be audited, improved, and forked.
          In a world where encryption is licensed, weakened, or withheld, open tools give us the power to build protection on our own terms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Key Open-Source Libraries</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenSSL:</strong> The backbone of HTTPS and TLS — includes symmetric, asymmetric, and hash functions with deep configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>libsodium:</strong> Modern and minimal. Designed to avoid developer mistakes and promote safe defaults.</li>
          <li><strong>Botan:</strong> C++ library optimized for embedded environments. Supports ECC, RSA, GOST, and more.</li>
          <li><strong>Bouncy Castle:</strong> Java and C# libraries widely used in Android, enterprise apps, and mobile wallets.</li>
          <li><strong>Crypto++:</strong> Research-grade C++ toolkit with support for legacy and experimental algorithms.</li>
          <li><strong>Libgcrypt:</strong> Used by GnuPG. Modular, standards-compliant, and often deployed in Linux tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Interoperability and Control</h2>
        <p>
          Choosing a library isn’t just a technical decision — it’s about what you prioritize: simplicity, compatibility, speed, or resilience.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Libsodium:</strong> Drops legacy ciphers in favor of forward-secure, misuse-resistant designs.</li>
          <li><strong>OpenSSL:</strong> Supports everything — which makes it powerful but complex to harden.</li>
          <li><strong>GnuTLS:</strong> Built with open-source compliance in mind — often found on public infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The tool you pick ends up shaping your threat model, your assumptions, and your vulnerabilities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Cryptography Is Political</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptographic tools define who can speak securely — and who cannot. They structure access, visibility, and autonomy.
          Governments regulate them. Corporations monetize them. Activists deploy them. The libraries you choose reflect values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption isn’t just about hiding things. It’s about building spaces where surveillance can’t reach — and where vulnerable communities can collaborate, document, or dissent without being watched.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Choosing the Right Tool</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Command line:</strong> <code>gpg</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>age</code></li>
          <li><strong>In-browser apps:</strong> <code>libsodium.js</code>, <code>WebCrypto API</code></li>
          <li><strong>Embedded development:</strong> <code>Botan</code>, <code>Crypto++</code>, <code>Libgcrypt</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These tools aren’t interchangeable. They reflect assumptions. Picking one is a political act — whether you realize it or not.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Privacy Beyond Code: Browsers and Search</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptographic libraries are critical — but so are the surfaces you touch every day: your browser, your search engine, your defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most web infrastructure is built to extract. Even when your messages are encrypted, your patterns — clicks, queries, scrolls — are harvested.
          Tools like these help resist that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brave:</strong> Tracker blocking, HTTPS upgrades, and optional Tor routing.</li>
          <li><strong>Tor Browser:</strong> Onion-routed encryption for true IP anonymity — slower, but more private.</li>
          <li><strong>Firefox / LibreWolf:</strong> Customizable, open-source, and privacy-respecting when configured carefully.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Search engines also matter. What you search gets stored, profiled, monetized.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>DuckDuckGo:</strong> Private by default. Lightweight but functional.</li>
          <li><strong>Startpage:</strong> Anonymous wrapper around Google results — no profiling.</li>
          <li><strong>SearXNG / Mojeek:</strong> Open metasearch and independent indexing — built for privacy, not profit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Using these tools is about more than reducing your “data exhaust.” It’s about refusing systems that turn attention into asset and behavior into product.
