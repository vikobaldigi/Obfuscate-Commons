        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Start with Ciphers?</h2>
        <p>
          Long before encryption relied on prime numbers or elliptic curves, it relied on language games.
          A cipher is one of the oldest methods of obfuscation: a way to turn everyday writing into something opaque.
        </p>
        <p>
          Substitution ciphers replace letters, symbols, or entire words with others. The message isn't deleted — just disguised.
          This is cryptography as disguise, as camouflage. And it's where most cryptographic systems begin: with a simple trick.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Caesar Cipher</h2>
        <p>
          Julius Caesar wrote encrypted messages to his generals by shifting each letter forward three places in the alphabet.
          <code>A → D</code>, <code>B → E</code>, <code>Z → C</code>. It's a form of what we now call a <strong>monoalphabetic substitution cipher</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are only 25 possible shifts. A determined reader could simply try each one until meaning appears. Still, it introduces a key idea: <strong>ciphertext</strong> — encrypted language requiring a key.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">From Substitution to Frequency</h2>
        <p>
          Ciphers that preserve letter frequencies — like Caesar’s — are vulnerable to <strong>frequency analysis</strong>.
          In English, for example, <code>E</code> is the most common letter. If a ciphertext symbol appears most frequently, it's likely mapped from <code>E</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formalized during the Islamic Golden Age, this technique became foundational to Western cryptanalysis during the Renaissance.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Polyalphabetic Illusion: Vigenère</h2>
        <p>
          The Vigenère cipher uses a keyword to apply multiple Caesar-style shifts to the plaintext. If the keyword is <code>KEY</code>, the message <code>HELLO</code> becomes a scramble based on <code>K → 10</code>, <code>E → 4</code>, <code>Y → 24</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once thought unbreakable, it was cracked in the 1800s by identifying repeating sequences to estimate keyword length — then attacking each Caesar alphabet individually.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Beyond Paper: Cipher Machines</h2>
        <p>
          During the 20th century, cipher machines like <strong>Enigma</strong> and the <strong>Hagelin M-209</strong> used rotors and wheels to automate substitution.
          Enigma had over 150 trillion settings — but failed due to poor key discipline and repeated messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems showed that complexity alone doesn’t ensure security — implementation matters.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Cipher ≠ Code</h2>
        <p>
          Codes substitute words or phrases; ciphers manipulate letters or bits. Codes require secrecy of a shared book. Ciphers require secrecy of a key.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern cryptography, ciphers scale. Codes do not.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          These systems may seem quaint — but they illuminate core cryptographic tensions: concealment vs. legibility, randomness vs. pattern, and trust vs. tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t study them to reuse them. We study them because today’s systems fail in the same ways: repetition, pattern, assumption.
