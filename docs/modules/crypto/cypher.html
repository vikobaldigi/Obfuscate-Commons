        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Start with Ciphers?</h2>
        <p>
          Long before cryptography involved prime numbers or elliptic curves, it started with everyday language.
          Substitution ciphers are among the oldest methods of obfuscation: replacing letters or symbols to make a message unreadable to outsiders.
        </p>
        <p>
          These early systems didn’t erase meaning — they disguised it. They remind us that the core of encryption isn’t just math. It’s misalignment, resistance, and control over visibility.

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Caesar Cipher</h2>
        <p>
          Julius Caesar used a simple cipher: shift each letter three places forward. <code>A → D</code>, <code>B → E</code>, and so on.
          This is known as a <strong>monoalphabetic substitution cipher</strong> — one alphabet, shuffled.
        </p>
        <p>
          With only 25 possible shifts, it's easy to break by trial. But the idea is foundational: a method of encrypting language using a shared, secret rule — a key.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Frequency Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Ciphers like Caesar’s preserve the original structure — especially letter frequency.
          In English, <code>E</code> is the most common letter. A frequent symbol in ciphertext often maps to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique — <strong>frequency analysis</strong> — was formalized by Arab mathematicians in the 9th century,
          then rediscovered during the European Renaissance. It turned cryptanalysis into a science.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Polyalphabetic Disguise</h2>
        <p>
          The Vigenère cipher improves on Caesar by using a repeating keyword. Each letter of the key shifts a letter of the message.
          With the key <code>KEY</code>, <code>HELLO</code> becomes a sequence of shifting alphabets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For centuries it was called “le chiffre indéchiffrable” — the indecipherable cipher — until it was broken by exploiting patterns in the repetition.
          A longer key means less pattern, but not zero pattern.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Machines of Obfuscation</h2>
        <p>
          In the 20th century, substitution went mechanical. Devices like <strong>Enigma</strong> and the <strong>Hagelin M-209</strong>
          used rotors and gears to automate shifting alphabets. Enigma had more than 150 trillion possible settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even with that complexity, it failed — not because of math, but because of implementation: reused messages, predictable openings, operator habits.
          Obfuscation fails when humans create patterns they don't realize they're repeating.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Cipher vs. Code</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>cipher</strong> works at the letter or bit level, rearranging form. A <strong>code</strong> substitutes whole words or phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Codes are brittle — they require memorization or lookup tables. Ciphers are scalable, mathematical, and resilient to compression and automation.
          Modern cryptography uses ciphers. Codes are history.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Why It Still Matters</h2>
        <p>
          These early systems may feel like puzzles — but the lessons hold.
          They show us where cryptography fails: in repetition, in shortcuts, in patterns that leak what we thought we’d hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Substitution reminds us that secrecy is always partial — and that even the simplest disguises have consequences.
