        <h2 class="section-heading">What Is Symmetric Encryption?</h2>
        <p>
          Symmetric encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. If you and I share the same key, I can lock the message, and you can unlock it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's simple, fast, and efficient ‚Äî especially for large volumes of data. But it depends on one fragile thing: keeping that shared key secret.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Block vs Stream</h2>
        <p>
          Symmetric algorithms come in two flavors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Block ciphers</strong> (like AES): encrypt data in fixed-size chunks. Think of it like sealing one box at a time.</li>
          <li><strong>Stream ciphers</strong> (like ChaCha20): encrypt data bit by bit or byte by byte. Think of it like turning on a hose of encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Both are fast and secure when used correctly. But misuse ‚Äî like reusing a key or skipping padding ‚Äî can crack them wide open.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Historical Ciphers</h2>
        <p>
          Before AES and ChaCha, we had:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Caesar Cipher</strong>: shift letters by a fixed amount</li>
          <li><strong>Vigen√®re Cipher</strong>: cycle through multiple Caesar ciphers using a keyword</li>
          <li><strong>Playfair, Enigma, XOR</strong>: various historical and wartime ciphers that still shape modern thought</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These were symmetric too ‚Äî same key in, same key out. Today, they're broken ‚Äî but conceptually foundational.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Modern Symmetric Standards</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</strong>: the global standard. Fast, robust, and widely trusted.</li>
          <li><strong>ChaCha20</strong>: a modern stream cipher designed to be fast and secure even on mobile devices.</li>
          <li><strong>RC4, DES</strong>: older algorithms no longer considered secure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Symmetric ciphers are used everywhere: disk encryption, VPNs, file storage, and messaging apps. They‚Äôre the workhorses of privacy.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Risks and Tradeoffs</h2>
        <p>
          The main risk in symmetric encryption is key distribution. How do you share a key with someone securely ‚Äî before you have a secure channel?
        </p>
        <p>
          That‚Äôs why symmetric systems are often paired with public-key systems. You use public-key crypto to exchange the symmetric key, then switch to symmetric for speed.
