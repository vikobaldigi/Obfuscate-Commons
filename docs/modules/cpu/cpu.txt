Encryption, codebreaking, and control at the foundation of 
digital resistance.

------------------------------------------------------------------
What Is Encryption?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only
authorized parties can access it. It doesn’t hide or erase data—
it transforms it into something unreadable to outsiders.

As Brunton and Nissenbaum write in *Obfuscation*, encryption is
a way to resist default surveillance. It's not invisibility—
it's refusal.

------------------------------------------------------------------
From Caesar to Complexity
------------------------------------------------------------------

Early ciphers like Caesar’s used simple letter shifts. These 
"monoalphabetic substitutions" could be broken by frequency 
analysis.

Modern cryptography (RSA, AES, ECC) relies on modular arithmetic,
probability, and large prime factorization—designed to resist 
brute-force attacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Keys and Meaning
------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption depends on a key.

- Symmetric: same key for encryption and decryption
- Asymmetric: public key locks, private key unlocks

This model powers everything from secure messaging to blockchain 
transactions.

See: Katz & Lindell, *Introduction to Modern Cryptography*

------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the CPU?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The CPU executes all encryption instructions. Every command
you run—`gpg`, `openssl`, `age`—is broken into machine-level 
math by the processor.

Understanding encryption means understanding what your machine 
is doing behind the scenes.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Encryption and Control
------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption is control.

As Singh writes in *The Code Book*, cryptography lets people 
decide *who* gets to know *what*, and *when*.

It enables autonomy in hostile systems. It doesn't make you
safe—but it makes you harder to predict.
