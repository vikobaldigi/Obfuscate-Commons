        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Encryption?</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption is how we protect what matters in a digital world. Not just from bad actors — but from institutions that collect, monetize, or manipulate what we do online. 
          It’s about controlling how our data moves, and who gets to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          While corporations push encryption as a compliance feature or premium service, its roots are far older and far more personal:
          protecting speech, sheltering dissent, and securing the right to be unreadable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Encryption vs Obfuscation</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption scrambles information so only someone with the right key can unlock it. Obfuscation takes a different route:
          it overwhelms surveillance with noise — false leads, junk signals, plausible deniability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they don’t just hide — they challenge the idea that digital systems should always be transparent to power.

        <h2 class="section-heading">From Caesar to Surveillance</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption has always been political. Julius Caesar used a crude cipher to protect military messages.
          That impulse — to keep meaning safe — has evolved alongside empires, militaries, and mass communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern algorithms like RSA and AES rely on serious math to resist not just hackers, but institutional surveillance.
          They protect against brute force, but also against the passive data collection that underwrites today’s digital economy.

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          There are two core models for encryption today. Knowing the difference helps you understand how your tools work — and when they’re most useful.
        </p>
        <table class="encryption-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>Key Model</th>
              <th>Examples</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Symmetric</td>
              <td>One shared key</td>
              <td>AES, ChaCha20</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Asymmetric</td>
              <td>Public/private keypair</td>
              <td>RSA, ECC</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          Symmetric is fast and secure — as long as you already trust the person you're sharing with.
          Asymmetric allows strangers to exchange data securely in public. Most encrypted systems use both in combination.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Beyond Corporate Security</h2>
        <p>
          Most encryption you hear about is framed around protecting financial data or corporate secrets.
          But the deeper purpose is about protecting people — especially those navigating vulnerable, risky, or oppressive systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're sharing sensitive research, archiving community records, or just texting without surveillance,
          encryption gives you a choice: to decide who gets to read you, and who doesn’t.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Frequency Analysis and Cipher Cracking</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier ciphers — like Caesar and Vigenère — were broken by noticing patterns.
          Letter frequencies, common digraphs, and structure gave them away. This led to the field of cryptanalysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern encryption systems are built to resist these techniques — through randomized output, large key sizes, and deliberate complexity.
          But the principle still stands: any pattern left unprotected can become a vulnerability.
