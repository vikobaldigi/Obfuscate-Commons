        <h2 class="section-heading">What Is Encryption?</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it. It doesn’t erase or hide data—it transforms it. In practice, encryption defines access: who gets to know what.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Brunton and Nissenbaum write in <em>Obfuscation</em>, encryption is a way of drawing boundaries in a system designed to flatten them. It enables refusal—not by absence, but by calculated unintelligibility.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">From Caesar to Complexity</h2>
        <p>
          Historical ciphers like Caesar’s—where letters are shifted—form the basis of modern encryption. In <em>The Mathematics of Secrets</em>, Holden shows how early “monoalphabetic” systems evolved into mathematical constructions that power digital security today.
        </p>
        <div id="caesar-canvas" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>
        <p>
          Where Caesar’s cipher could be broken in seconds, algorithms like RSA or AES are backed by modular arithmetic and number theory, designed to withstand brute-force attacks and eavesdropping.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Keys and Meaning</h2>
        <p>
          All encryption relies on <strong>keys</strong>: secrets that determine how data is scrambled and how it can be reversed. In symmetric systems, the same key locks and unlocks. In asymmetric systems, one key encrypts, and another decrypts.
        </p>
        <div id="key-canvas" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>
        <p>
          Public key encryption, first formalized in the 1970s, makes it possible to communicate securely without pre-sharing a secret. This idea—explained in detail by Katz and Lindell—is the cornerstone of secure email, messaging apps, and blockchain authentication.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Why the CPU?</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption happens in the mind, but it's executed by machines. Every <code>gpg</code>, <code>openssl</code>, or <code>age</code> command runs operations through your CPU. It translates abstract keys into physical silicon logic.
        </p>
        <div id="cipher-canvas" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>
        <p>
          Modular arithmetic—the math behind most crypto algorithms—is performed millions of times per second on physical hardware. When we say “learn encryption,” we’re also learning how instructions become electric.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Encryption and Control</h2>
        <p>
          As Singh writes in <em>The Code Book</em>, cryptography is fundamentally about control—over identity, access, and memory. Encryption lets people maintain control over what can be known, long after a message leaves their hands.
        </p>
        <div id="freq-canvas" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>
        <p>
          But encryption is also political. It resists systems of surveillance, prediction, and extraction. It gives individuals, collectives, and movements the tools to determine who gets to interpret their messages—and who doesn’t.
