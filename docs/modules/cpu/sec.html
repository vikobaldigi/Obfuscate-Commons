        <h2 class="section-heading">From Theory to Reality</h2>
        <p>
          In the last module, we learned what encryption is: a way to turn readable data into unreadable noise — unless you have the key.
          But just because something is encrypted doesn’t mean it’s safe. In practice, encryption fails all the time.
          Not because the math is wrong. But because people — and the systems we build — make mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This module is about those mistakes. What happens when encryption “works” — and still lets you down.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">It’s Not the Math</h2>
        <p>
          Most <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#cryptographic-failure">cryptographic failures</a> don’t come from someone breaking the cipher.
          They come from what Ross Anderson famously called “the seams” — the places where encryption meets real-world <a href="../glossary/glossary.html#infrastructure">infrastructure</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using strong encryption, but sending the data over an insecure network</li>
          <li>Forgetting to verify a certificate before trusting it</li>
          <li>Using outdated or broken algorithms like <span data-tooltip="A 1970s-era encryption method now considered insecure.">DES</span> or <span data-tooltip="A hash algorithm vulnerable to collision attacks.">MD5</span></li>
          <li>Hardcoding the encryption key into an app for anyone to find</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These aren’t fringe cases. They’re common — and they happen because software is built by humans, in a rush, under pressure, and often without a deep understanding of cryptography.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">What Breaks in the Wild</h2>
        <p>Let’s look at a few well-known examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple's “goto fail” bug</strong> (2014): One extra line of code accidentally disabled certificate validation in macOS and iOS.</li>
          <li><strong>Debian OpenSSL</strong> (2006–2008): A cleanup patch removed key randomness, generating predictable keys for two years.</li>
          <li><strong>Android APK vulnerability</strong> (2013): A bug allowed malicious apps to be signed with a legitimate key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These bugs weren’t obscure. They were live in billions of devices. And all of them involved systems that were supposedly “secure.”
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">When People Don’t Trust the Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Even when encryption is available, people might not use it — or trust it.
          In one study, users of WhatsApp (which offers end-to-end encryption) thought they had to turn it on manually, or believed SMS was more secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tool that isn’t understood is a tool that won’t be used well. This is one of the most consistent causes of failure in digital security: the design forgets that humans are part of the system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Big Lesson</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption doesn’t guarantee safety — it <em>enables</em> safety. Whether it works depends on everything around it: the infrastructure, the defaults, the code, and the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why this module matters: it teaches us that security isn’t just technical — it’s political, social, and deeply human.
