        <h2 class="section-heading">From Theory to Reality</h2>
        <p>
          In the last module, we learned what encryption is: a way to turn readable data into unreadable noise — unless you have the key.
          But just because something is encrypted doesn’t mean it’s safe. In practice, encryption fails all the time.
          Not because the math is wrong. But because people — and the systems we build — make mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This module is about those mistakes. What happens when encryption “works” — and still lets you down.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">It’s Not the Math</h2>
        <p>
          Most cryptographic failures don’t come from someone breaking the cipher.
          They come from what Ross Anderson famously called “the seams” — the places where encryption meets real-world infrastructure.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using strong encryption, but sending the data over an insecure network</li>
          <li>Forgetting to verify a certificate before trusting it</li>
          <li>Using outdated or broken algorithms like DES or MD5</li>
          <li>Hardcoding the encryption key into an app for anyone to find</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These aren’t fringe cases. They’re common — and they happen because software is built by humans, in a rush, under pressure, and often without a deep understanding of cryptography.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">What Breaks in the Wild</h2>
        <p>Let’s look at a few well-known examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple's “goto fail” bug</strong> (2014): A duplicated line of code in Apple’s SSL/TLS implementation caused the certificate check to always succeed — even if the signature was invalid.
            [<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-goto-fail-bug/" target="_blank">Wired</a>,
            <a href="https://www.blackducksoftware.com/blog/understanding-apple-goto-fail-vulnerability-2" target="_blank">Black Duck</a>]
            <details><summary>Read more</summary>
              <p>
                The flaw stemmed from an extra <code>goto fail;</code> line in Apple’s SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange function. This caused the function to exit early — skipping critical certificate signature checks. The bug went unnoticed for months, despite Apple's reputation for strong security, and was live in both iOS and macOS.
              </p>
            </details>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Debian OpenSSL vulnerability</strong> (2006–2008): A well-intentioned cleanup in Debian’s version of OpenSSL accidentally disabled entropy sources, making all cryptographic keys generated during this time dangerously predictable.
            [<a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571" target="_blank">Debian Advisory</a>,
            <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Research/rsc-debian-openssl.pdf" target="_blank">RSC Lessons</a>]
            <details><summary>Read more</summary>
              <p>
                The problem began when a Debian maintainer commented out just two lines of code in OpenSSL’s random number generator. This removed the primary entropy source. As a result, keys generated during this two-year period were easily guessable.
              </p>
            </details>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Android APK signature bypass</strong> (2013): A flaw in how Android verified APK files (Android Package Kits — the file format used to distribute and install apps) allowed attackers to inject malicious code without invalidating the app's cryptographic signature.
            [<a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/blog/android-security-bypass-vulnerability-dec-6-2013/" target="_blank">SonicWall</a>,
            <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-6792" target="_blank">NVD</a>]
            <details><summary>Read more</summary>
              <p>
                The vulnerability exploited differences in how APK files were parsed during signature check vs. installation. Attackers could inject malicious code while still passing signature validation.
              </p>
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These bugs weren’t obscure. They were live in billions of devices. And all of them involved systems that were supposedly “secure.”

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">When People Don’t Trust the Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Even when encryption is available, people might not use it — or trust it. In one study, users of WhatsApp thought they had to turn on encryption manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tool that isn’t understood is a tool that won’t be used well. This is one of the most consistent causes of failure in digital security.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Big Lesson</h2>
        <p>
          Encryption doesn’t guarantee safety — it <em>enables</em> safety. Whether it works depends on everything around it: the infrastructure, the defaults, the code, and the people.
