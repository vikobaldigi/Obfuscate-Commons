        <h2 class="section-heading">What This Module Covers</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptography doesn't usually fail because someone breaks the math. It fails in the seams — between users and software, protocols and infrastructure. 
          This module explores real-world examples of how encryption breaks down in practice, despite working “perfectly” in theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          SEC refers to <strong>Sensitive Data Exposure</strong>, a top vulnerability on the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a>. 
          But we’re not just looking at technical missteps. We're asking: why do these failures keep happening, and what do they reveal about our systems?

        <h2 class="section-heading">Failure Isn’t in the Math</h2>
        <p>
          Ross Anderson’s <em>Why Cryptosystems Fail</em> made the case that most cryptographic breakdowns aren’t cryptanalytic. 
          They’re about bad key handling, poor assumptions, or failures in how people use the system. 
          We still see that everywhere — in outdated protocols, bad certificate validation, and insecure defaults that go unnoticed until there’s a breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Systems fail when they trust too much: a server not using TLS, a site storing passwords in plaintext, an app hardcoding its encryption key. 
          These aren’t rare exceptions — they’re common practice.

        <h2 class="section-heading">When Everything “Works” — and Still Fails</h2>
        <p>
          As <em>Digital Seams</em> documents, a secure messaging group leaked not because encryption broke, but because someone added the wrong person to the chat. 
          The system worked exactly as designed — the failure was human, procedural, and infrastructural.
        </p>
        <p>
          These kinds of breakdowns aren’t rare. They’re structural. They remind us that encryption depends on people, not just protocols — 
          and that any design that ignores human factors is already compromised.

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Misuse and Misunderstanding</h2>
        <p>
          In <em>In Encryption We Don’t Trust</em>, researchers found that even after WhatsApp adopted end-to-end encryption, most users didn’t trust it — or understand it. 
          Some thought encryption had to be turned on. Others believed SMS was safer. Many ignored the messages entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          A security feature only works when people use it — and know what it’s doing. Misunderstanding creates gaps in protection, and those gaps are often the first thing exploited.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">What the Data Tells Us</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Cryptobugs</em> study from MIT CSAIL found that the vast majority of cryptographic failures come not from breaking algorithms, but from how they’re used. 
          Misuse of libraries, insecure defaults, and unvetted code integrations lead to real-world vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Broken or deprecated algorithms (RC4, SHA-1, DES)</li>
          <li>Hardcoded or default keys in production code</li>
          <li>Missing certificate validation in SSL/TLS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These aren’t obscure bugs. They’re found in public infrastructure, mobile apps, and consumer tools — because encryption is hard to use right, even when it’s available.

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Secure Systems That Still Leak</h2>
        <p>
          Soudijn et al.’s <em>When Encryption Fails</em> documents cases like EncroChat, where encrypted phones were compromised not through crypto, but through infrastructure. 
          Once the servers were captured, millions of messages were exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It lives inside ecosystems — platforms, protocols, user decisions. And when one layer breaks, the illusion of security does too.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Failure Is How We Learn</h2>
        <p>
          If we want to build better cryptographic systems, we need to study where they break — not just at the edges, but at the core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying failure is not an attack on encryption. It’s an investment in real security. 
          Because systems that learn are the only ones that improve.
