        <h2 class="section-heading">What Is Metadata?</h2>
        <p>
          Metadata is often described as “data about data,” but this description is too shallow. As Pomerantz explains in <em>Metadata</em>,
          metadata is a way of managing complexity — simplifying rich information into legible, extractable fragments. It structures the digital world
          and makes it searchable, sortable, and surveillable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your devices emit metadata constantly: timestamps, IP addresses, geolocations, file types, browsing paths.
          These traces are rarely seen by users, but they are captured, aggregated, and analyzed across platforms.
          Metadata isn’t just technical — it’s political. It determines who is visible, to whom, and under what conditions.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Networks of Metadata</h2>
        <p>
          Metadata flows through networks. As Pomerantz outlines using graph theory, networks are made of <em>nodes</em> (users, devices)
          and <em>edges</em> (relationships: calls, messages, visits). Metadata lives in these edges — it describes when and how connections happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Facebook to phone records, social graphs model behavior using metadata.
          These structures are not neutral — they’re shaped by design, law, and business.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Metadata as Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Metadata is foundational to the modern web. It powers search engines, surveillance systems, and personalization algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pomerantz writes that metadata “fades into the background” — it structures visibility and memory but is rarely seen.
          It’s how we are read by machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manovich adds that metadata feeds cultural analytics: tags, views, behaviors, paths. It’s a second layer of cultural record.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Surveillance and Inference</h2>
        <p>
          The Snowden leaks revealed how metadata drives modern surveillance. “We kill people based on metadata,” said NSA director Hayden.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not what you said — it’s who you’re near, when you talk, how often. This is enough to target and infer identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cultural institutions use this same metadata logic to infer taste, attention, and influence.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Obfuscation as Metadata Resistance</h2>
        <p>
          You can’t erase metadata — but you can pollute it. Brunton and Nissenbaum propose obfuscation: misleading metadata, false patterns,
          randomized signals. This shifts the cost of surveillance back to the observer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obfuscation isn’t erasure. It’s friction. It’s a refusal to be fully legible to systems that demand transparency without consent.
