        <h2 class="section-heading">What Is a Terminal?</h2>
        <p>
          A terminal is a text-based interface that lets users communicate directly with a computer’s operating system.
          It bypasses graphical layers to offer raw control and visibility into system structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it may seem outdated, the terminal remains essential for developers, system administrators, and hackers alike.
          It reveals what most interfaces obscure — the file system’s skeleton, the machine’s vocabulary, and your own agency.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Why the Terminal Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Graphical interfaces are curated. They decide what is visible, clickable, or changeable. The terminal, by contrast,
          removes that layer of interpretation. It makes your interactions explicit.
        </p>
        <p>
          To quote <em>The Linux Command Line</em>: “GUI makes easy tasks easy, but the command line makes hard tasks possible.”
          Understanding it isn’t just about using different tools — it’s about seeing what your system assumes, hides, or protects.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Terminal as Text</h2>
        <p>
          The terminal isn’t just a technical tool — it’s a literacy. Knowing it changes your relationship to your machine.
          You see directories not as folders but as nested paths. You see files as streams of characters.
          You learn to manipulate, inspect, and transform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what gives the terminal its resistance quality. It’s not about nostalgia. It’s about control.
          About seeing what GUI layers are trying to keep quiet.
