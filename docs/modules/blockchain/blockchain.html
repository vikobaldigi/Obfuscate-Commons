        <h2 class="section-heading">What Is a Blockchain?</h2>
        <p>
          A blockchain is a shared digital ledger. It records transactions in a list of blocks, where each block is locked to the one before it using a cryptographic hash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a block is added, it can‚Äôt be changed without altering every block that follows ‚Äî and convincing everyone else in the network to accept the change. That‚Äôs what gives it its tamper resistance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain systems try to avoid centralized control. Instead of trusting a single authority, participants rely on <span data-tooltip="Algorithms that let distributed systems agree on a single data value.">consensus mechanisms</span> like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake to decide what counts as truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This lets people or systems interact securely ‚Äî even when they don‚Äôt know or trust each other.
        </p>

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Cryptography Underneath</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Keeps blocks linked and checks for tampering.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Prove who authorized a transaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Merkle Trees:</strong> Make it possible to verify small parts of large datasets quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These tools help ensure that data is authentic and hasn‚Äôt been changed ‚Äî but only if they‚Äôre used correctly.

      <section class="fade-in-up">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Privacy (or the Lack of It)</h2>
        <p>
          Public blockchains are transparent. Everyone can see every transaction. That‚Äôs useful for verification ‚Äî but bad for privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          More advanced tools like <strong>zk-SNARKs</strong> and <strong>zk-STARKs</strong> (zero-knowledge proofs) can help by letting you prove something without revealing the details.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Beyond Money</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency is just the beginning. Blockchains also support:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Code that runs automatically when conditions are met.</li>
          <li><strong>DAOs:</strong> Groups that run on-chain without central leaders.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Identity:</strong> Verified credentials and access systems that live on-chain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Problems and Politics</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain is often praised for decentralization. But in practice, a few actors often hold power ‚Äî through tokens, mining rigs, or code control.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also uses a lot of energy, can be hard to govern, and sometimes becomes a tool for speculation instead of social benefit.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Current Events: Crypto in 401(k)s</h2>
        <p>
          In May 2025, the Trump administration took steps to ease restrictions on including private cryptocurrency assets in retirement plans like 401(k)s. According to reporting by 
          <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/trump-crypto-stance-paves-way-for-private-assets-in-401-k-s" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/crypto-in-401k-plans-trump-administration-eases-rules.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, and the 
          <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc55d091-0b28-40bb-a11c-e32d4e121ca3" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, this deregulatory move was framed as empowering individual investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics argue the decision prioritizes financial speculation over long-term security. It may expose retirement funds to volatile and poorly regulated markets under the guise of choice and innovation. Rather than democratizing finance, this shift risks entrenching risk at the expense of vulnerable savers ‚Äî all while shielding institutional actors from accountability.
