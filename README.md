# Obfuscate Commons

**Obfuscate Commons** is an interactive digital prototype that envisions a counter-infrastructure for data and resistance through poetic obfuscation, generative art, and participatory encryption. Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), the project draws on the concept of the information undercommons as theorized by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten, and explores themes of algorithmic legibility, refusal, and encrypted visibility inspired by Louise Amoore’s *Cloud Ethics*.

This project was created for a graduate-level course on Data, Ethics & Society and builds upon frameworks of data justice, protest aesthetics, and fugitive knowledge infrastructures.

## Concept

Rather than rendering information transparent and machine-readable, this work cultivates a space where meaning is protected, fragmented, and only shared through communal codes or encrypted passphrases. Obfuscate Commons challenges dominant logics of visibility and surveillance by allowing users to interact with — but not immediately access — data visual elements.

## Features

- Floating encrypted messages that move across the screen
- Visual obfuscation using distorted glyphs and movement
- Blurred protest imagery as symbolic background
- Passphrase-based decryption interaction
- Custom poetic encryption inspired by traditions of resistance

## Built With

- p5.js – JavaScript creative coding library in the Processing ecosystem
- HTML/CSS – Project structure and styling
- JavaScript – Logic and interaction handling

## Theoretical Framework

- Stefano Harney & Fred Moten – *The Undercommons*
- Louise Amoore – *Cloud Ethics*
- Lisa Parks & Nicole Starosielski – *Signal Traffic*
