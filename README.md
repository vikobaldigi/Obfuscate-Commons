# üåå Obfuscate Commons

**Status:** üöß _Work In Progress_  
**Access:** üîí _Currently Restricted_

---

**Obfuscate Commons** is an interactive digital prototype that envisions a counter-infrastructure for data and resistance through poetic obfuscation, generative art, and participatory encryption. Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), the project draws inspiration from the concept of the information undercommons as theorized by **Stefano Harney and Fred Moten**, exploring themes of algorithmic legibility, refusal, and encrypted visibility inspired by **Louise Amoore‚Äôs Cloud Ethics**.

This project was developed for a graduate-level course on **Data, Ethics & Society** and builds upon frameworks of data justice, protest aesthetics, and fugitive knowledge infrastructures.

## ‚ú® Concept

Rather than rendering information transparent and machine-readable, this work cultivates a space where meaning is **protected, fragmented**, and only shared through **communal codes** or **encrypted passphrases**.

> _"Obfuscate Commons" challenges dominant logics of visibility and surveillance by allowing users to interact with ‚Äî but not immediately access ‚Äî data visual elements._

## üß© Features

- Floating encrypted messages that move across the screen  
- Visual obfuscation using distorted glyphs and movement  
- Blurred protest imagery as symbolic background  
- Passphrase-based decryption interaction  
- Custom poetic encryption inspired by traditions of resistance

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obfuscate_commons.git
   cd obfuscate_commons
   python -m http.server
   ```
2. **Open** `index.html` in your browser at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`  
3. **Explore** the interface ‚Äî hover over encrypted messages  
4. **Click a star** and enter the passphrase to attempt decryption

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This is an **early prototype**. Most stars are non-functional, and encrypted chatrooms are currently **inaccessible** except for limited test elements (e.g., the Rigel node with passphrase `"brilliance"`).

Full access and documentation will be provided in future versions.

üúè _This project is part of an ongoing inquiry into encryption, resistance, and refusal in the digital age._
